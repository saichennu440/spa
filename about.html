              <font color="#2C3539"> Massage Therapist:Massage therapy is used to help manage a health condition or enhance wellness. It involves manipulating the soft tissues of the body. Massage has been practiced in most cultures, both Eastern and Western, throughout human history, and was one of the earliest tools that people used to try to relieve pain.</li>
 <li>Massage therapy, with or without aromatherapy (the use of essential oils) has been used to attempt to relieve pain, anxiety, and other symptoms in people with cancer. A 2016 evaluation of 19 studies (more than 1,200 participants) of massage for cancer patients found some evidence that massage might help with pain and anxiety, but the quality of the evidence was very low (because most studies were small and some may have been biased), and findings were not consistent.</li>
<li>Clinical practice guidelines (guidance for health care providers) for the care of breast cancer patients include massage as one of several approaches that may be helpful for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life. Clinical practice guidelines for the care of lung cancer patients suggest that massage therapy could be added as part of supportive care in patients whose anxiety or pain is not adequately controlled by usual care.</li>
<li>Massage therapists may need to modify their usual techniques when working with cancer patients; for example, they may have to use less pressure than usual in areas that are sensitive because of cancer or cancer treatments.

              <font color="#2C3539">Esthetician:Estheticians are professionals trained to provide treatments to the outermost layers of your skin. They can offer guidance with caring for and improving the appearance of your skin.</font></font>
Unlike dermatologists, they don’t have medical training, so they typically can’t do things like:</font></font>

<li>diagnose skin conditions</li>
<li>prescribe medications</li>
<li>perform any kind of invasive treatments, including injectables and fillers</li>
<li>In some states, estheticians may be able to perform injectables and other procedures with a dermatologist’s supervision.</li>

Some examples of services an esthetician can offer include:

<li>facials</li>
<li>microdermabrasion</li>
<li>hair removal procedures like waxing, threading, and sugaring</li>
<li>makeup application, including eyebrow tinting and eyelash extensions</li>
<li>body scrubs, masks, and wraps</li>
<li>some types of superficial chemical peels — they can’t perform aggressive peels that penetrate deeper into the skin</li>
<li>Estheticians often work at salons or day spas.</li></p>

            <p><li>Spa Manager:A spa manager is responsible for overseeing the daily operations of a spa, ensuring that it runs smoothly and efficiently. This role requires excellent organizational, leadership, and communication skills. Spa managers are responsible for managing staff, developing and implementing spa policies and procedures, creating and managing budgets, and ensuring that the spa meets its revenue targets. They also oversee the development of new spa treatments, the marketing of the spa, and the management of customer relations.</li>

<li>In addition to managing staff and operations, spa managers are also responsible for ensuring that the spa provides exceptional service to its clients. This involves developing and implementing customer service standards, training staff on how to provide excellent service, and ensuring that client feedback is taken into account in the development of new treatments and services. Spa managers must also ensure that the spa is compliant with all relevant health and safety regulations, and that staff are trained in all necessary safety procedures.</p></li>
